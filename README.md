# GiphyHub

To run this app locally you'll need to add your Giphy API key. Following the example in `src/secret_example.js`, create a file called `src/secret.js` to include your key. Then run:

```
yarn
yarn start
```

Or with npm:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will launch the app from `localhost:3000`.
